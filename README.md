## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a retail sales dataset, completed as part of my internship assignment.
The analysis focuses on identifying sales patterns, seasonal trends, customer purchasing behavior, and product performance.
The goal is to extract actionable insights that can help in strategic decision-making, such as optimizing inventory, improving marketing campaigns, and identifying high-value customers.
